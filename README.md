# MapBox Me

Small reference implementation of native iPhone MapBox maps. Displays user's location & heading on MapBox Streets somewhat like Maps.app.

Makes use of the built-in user location services capabilities of the [MapBox iOS SDK](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-ios-sdk).

Since this project uses submodules, you'll need to check them out, or clone the project with

    git clone --recursive git://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-me.git
