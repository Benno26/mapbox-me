# MapBox Me

Small reference implementation of native iPhone MapBox maps. Displays user's location on MapBox Streets somewhat like Maps.app.

Needs improvement, as Route-Me doesn't feature a built-in "home in on user" functionality. 

Since this project uses submodules, you'll need to check them out, or clone the project with

    git clone --recursive git@github.com:mapbox/mapbox-me.git
